# chatUwu
chat-cmd-uwu is a simple command-line based chat application that allows communication between different PCs over a network using Python's socket programming.
This project demonstrates basic client-server architecture and multi-threading to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

# Features
- Simple Setup: Easy to set up and run using Python.
- Multi-client Support: Supports multiple clients communicating with each other through a single server.
- Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Getting Started
**Prerequisites**

1.) Python 3.x installed on all machines.

2.) Basic knowledge of using command-line interface (CMD, Terminal).

**Installation**

_git clone https://github.com/PhitzZ/chatUwu_

_cd chat-cmd-uwu_

**Install dependencies**

_pip install -r requirements.txt_

_pip install colorama_

# Usage
Starting the Server
1.) Open a terminal (CMD on Windows).
2.) Navigate to the project directory.
3.) Start the server by specifying the host and port:

_python server.py 0.0.0.0 9999_

This starts the server listening on all network interfaces at port 9999.

# Connecting Clients

1.) Open another terminal for each client.

2.) Navigate to the project directory.

3.) Start the client by specifying the server's IP address and port:

_python client.py <server_ip> 9999_

Replace <server_ip> with the actual IP address of the machine running the server.

Type messages in the client terminal to send them to the server, which will broadcast them to all connected clients. 
Type **exit** to disconnect.

# Example

**Server:**
_python server.py 0.0.0.0 9999_


**Client 1:**
_python client.py 192.168.1.100 9999_
